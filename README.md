# Overview
This project presents a comprehensive exploratory and business-focused analysis of transactional pizza sales data. The objective is to uncover demand drivers, pricing dynamics, sales patterns, and time-based performance trends that can inform operational and strategic decision-making.
Using relational datasets (orders, order details, pizza_types and pizzas), this analysis transforms raw transactional data into actionable business insights.

# Business Objectives

- Which pizza types and sizes drive the highest demand?

- Which pizza categories generate the most revenue?

Which days generate the highest sales volume and revenue?

What does the distribution of daily sales look like?

What is the average order frequency?

What are the peak sales periods during the day?

How do sales vary between weekdays and weekends?
